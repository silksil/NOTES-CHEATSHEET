### Expressions
Expressions produce value. Expressions are Javascript code snippets that result in a single value. Expressions can be as long as you want them to be, but they would always result in a single value.
When you combine elements like numbers, variables and strings, you will use expressions. The simplest example is the addition of two numbers:
```js
4 + 5
```

This is an "expression". In this case, it consists of:

- the addition operator (+)
- two literals, namely 4 and 5.

### Operators
Types of oeprators:
- Numerical operators
- Increment and decrement
- (In)equality
- Comparisons
- Boolean operators


### Literals 
Literals, or literal expressions, are values that are writting down directly, without the use of variables or any other language feature (such as functions or more operators). Think of it this way: 9 is literally 9, but 4 + 5 not (you first have to compute it).


### Technical terms
- **Evaluation** is actually just the technical term for "to compute". For instance, 4 + 5 evaluates to 9. Programmers like to say "evaluates" instead of "computes". For more talk on evaluation, check out the Advanced Topics section of this module.
