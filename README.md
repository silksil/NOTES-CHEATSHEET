#### What is this? 
> I trust the weakest pen more than the strongest memory - Tim Ferris

This repository keeps track of what I have encountered and learnerd accross the different technologies that I have been exploring and using. Simple but effective note taking enables me to:
- Keep track of best practices. 
- Use it as a 'cheatsheet' to create functionality in a shorter period of time than If I had to do from stretch.  
- To continuously pivot on the best way to create certain functionality. 
- Impose structure on information for increased retention and recall.
- Show to the outside world what I can. 


#### What does it includes?
My current preffered stack is React-Redux, NodeJs, Express and MongoDB and my notes are also mainly focusing on these technologies. Additionality it will include topics that are more generic, such as [how to be productive](https://github.com/silksil/NOTES-CHEATSHEET/blob/master/productivity.md).
