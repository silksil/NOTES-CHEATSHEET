> I trust the weakest pen more than the strongest memory - Tim Ferris

#### What is this? 
This repository keeps track of what I have encountered and learned across the different technologies that I have been exploring and using. Note taking enables me to:
- Use it as a 'cheatsheet' to be more efficient and effective.  
- To continuously pivot on the best way to create certain functionalities. 
- Impose structure on information for increased retention and recall.

#### What does it include?
The technologies that I have been focusing on are:
- React
- Next.js
- Apollo
- GraphQl
- Redux
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDb 

As a result, the notes focus mainly on these technologies. Additionality, it includes topics that are more generic, such as [how to be productive](https://github.com/silksil/NOTES-CHEATSHEET/blob/master/productivity.md).
