# Learning Goals
- What is the difference between inheritance and composition?

# Inheritance and Composition
## Inheritance
With inheritance, a base class (a.k.a. base type) defines the state and behavior common for a given type and lets the subclasses (a.k.a. subtypes) provide *specialized version*s of that state and behavior.

## Composition
Composition allows us to model objects that are made up of other objects, thus defining a *“has-a”* relationship between them. Furthermore, the composition is the strongest form of association, which means that the object(s) that compose or are contained by one object are destroyed too when that object is destroyed.
