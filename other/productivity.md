## Productivity principles
### Vidualization
Use visualization through the form of diagrams or maps to understand the problem you are solving, and to define how you gonna solve the problem. It can help to:
- Understand the big picture.
- Understand the individual steps/parts.

### Timebox
Timebox if you are stuck. State to yourself 'if I am stuck longer than x minutes and x hours, I will ask for help from x'.

### Define and solve roadblocks
Ask yourself daily:
> Were there any roadblocks or was there anything that could be automated?

If the answer is yes and it takes less than 15 minutes to solve it, solve it, if it takes more than 15 mintues, create a task for. Examples of roadblocks can be:
- Not having access to certain files.
- Unclear documentation.
- Unorganized folder structure.
