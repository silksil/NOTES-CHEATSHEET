# Intro
Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

Functional code tends to be:
- More concise
- More predictable
- And easier to test than imperative or object oriented coding.

Functional programming favors:
- Pure functions instead of shared state & side effects
- Immutability over mutable data
- Function composition over imperative flow control
- Lots of generic, reusable utilities that use higher order functions to act on many data types instead of methods that only operate on their colocated data
- Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)
- Expressions over statements
- Containers & higher order functions over ad-hoc polymorphism
