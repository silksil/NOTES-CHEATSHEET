In order to determine whether someone is being logged-in or has the authentication,  we create an AuthReducer that can return three things:
| Situation      | AuthReducer Returns         | Notes  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Make request to bakcend to get current user    | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
