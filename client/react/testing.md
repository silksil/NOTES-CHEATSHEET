### Jest and JSDOM
Test are run with Jest - an automated test runner. When we run Jest it is being run in our terminal. If we run React it always expects it is executed in the browser. As the command line and the browser are not the same thing, we use the dependancy JSDOM - this replicates how the browser works.
