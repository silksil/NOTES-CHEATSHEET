Moxios allows you to watch axios for testing. Instead of conducting actual requests, you trick axios that it instantly gets a reponse. No acutal network request is being made, but maxios does return some data in place of the api you are doing a request to. So, basically, maxios fakes out your request.
```npm i maxios```
