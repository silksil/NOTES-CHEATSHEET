React-spring is a animation library for React. 

React-spring has several `primitives`, as in building blocks, that allows you to handle the animation. It includes the following primitives:
- **Spring:** The primary task of a Spring is to *move data* from one state to another. 
- **Transition:** A Transition animates component *lifecycles* as components mount, unmount or otherwise change.
- **Trail:** A Trail animates the first item of a *list* of elements, the rest form a natural trail and follow their previous sibling.
- **Keyframes:**  allow you to chain, compose and orchestrate animations. Keyframes is a factory that extends either springs or trails.
- **Parallax:** creates a scroll container. Throw in any amount of layers and it will take care of moving them in accordance to their offsets and speeds.
