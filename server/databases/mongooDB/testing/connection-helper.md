To check whether Mongoose is connected with mongo you go through the following steps:
1. Mocha starts.
2. Tell Mongoose to connect to Mongo 
  |
  | wait
  |
  Ë… 
3. Mongoose connects to Mongo
4. Connection succesfull? Run tests
5. Connection failed? Show error

This leads to the following code:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

/*
 Mongoose has its own promise library, which can show an error
 Here you state you use the ES6 library for promises
*/
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise

// State that you connect to mongo one time before all tests run
before((done) => {
  /*
  Here we specify where make the connection
  This says, on my local machine => find this
  If it remote, you would replace the localhost for a port
  The last part refers to the instance/db you have to connect to
  */
  mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/user_test');

  /*
    'once' and 'on' are event handler
    If you find an event called 'open' we are good to go
    If you find an event called 'on' we failed to connect
  */
  mongoose.connection
    // done() states: move one to first test, once you are connected
    .once('open', () => { done(); })
    .on('error', (error) => {
      console.warn('Warning', error);
    });
});

  /*
    We drop the db everytime we run a test
    We do this so that individual test are not impacted by each other
    Through 'drop' we take all records and delete it
  */
  beforeEach((done) => {
    /*  We include callack to make sure we don't skip to the next test
        untill we have finished the other test and dropped the included data
    */
    mongoose.connection.collections.users.drop(() => {
      done();
    });
  });
```
