![mongoDB-storeinfo](images/mongoDB-storeinfo.png?raw=true "MongoDB store info diagram") </br>
Mongo stores record in different collections. Every collection can have many different records. Every records is a JSON object.  Collections are schemaless; inside of every collection records with different properties can be included. 

### Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper (ODM). This means that Mongoose allows you to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document. Mongoose provides functionality around creating and working with schemas.
