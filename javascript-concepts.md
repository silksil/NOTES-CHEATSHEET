### Instances
"instance" is best understood as it relates to "class" in programming. "Classes" are used to define the properties and behavior of a category of things. E.g. A "Car" class might dictate that all cars be defined by their make, model, year, and mileage.
But you cant provide specifics about a particular car (for example, that 1978 Chevy Impala with 205,000 miles on it that your uncle Mickey drives) until you create an "instance" of a Car. It's the instance that captures the detailed information about one particular Car.

### Difference property, key and value
he term property (also: attribute, less common or even used for different things in JS) usually refers to the key/value pair that describes a member of an object. While, especially when used with a specific identifier (key), it often refers to the whole combination, it can also denote the value of that member. It does usually not mean the identifier itself.

When people try to be accurate, they distinguish between "property" (the whole thing, part of an object), "property name" (the string used as the key) and "property value" (the stored data).
