# What is SoC and how is it achieved? 
In a broad sense, SoC refers to the idea that computer programs should be separated into distinct sections so that each section addresses a specific concern. By distinguishing parts of our code within well-defined interfaces, we can create programs that have distinct subroutines mapped out into more readable terms. In doing so, we can maintain order within our program while allowing for more concise logical conclusions on a step-by-step basis.

Separation of concerns is achieved by **encapsulating** information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Other way to think about encapsulation is, it is a *protective shield* that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
