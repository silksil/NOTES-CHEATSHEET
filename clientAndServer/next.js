Next.js is a React framework for building web applications. It does:
- All of the tooling: webpack, code splitting etc.
- It does server-side rendering: if you care about instant loading, pre-loading, seo etc., server-side rendering is important. 
- it does the routing; there is no routing, there are pages.
