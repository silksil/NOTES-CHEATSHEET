Use the following process as a guide for coding.

## Per story
1. Define story (As a .. I want .. so that)
2. Define the definition of done
3. Define the subtasks
4. Also iclude in the substask repeated tasks (created automated unit and/or functional tests, review PR, test locally, test in dev, update documenation, showcase PM, approval PM, test in prod)
5. If the story is rather complex, visualize it, e.g. how different components relate to each other.
6. Set-up tests in relation to the story that should fail
7. Write the code so that all tests pass
8. Refactor
10. Test locally
11. Open PR and merge with Dev
12. Test in Dev
13. Showcase PM
14. Test in Prod
16. Update documentation
